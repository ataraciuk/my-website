The doll rotates based on the user's head position. he digital space will change based on the current detected expression from the user: the face of the doll, the decoration on its dress, the color of the background and the music. When the user is satisfied with the doll, he presses a button, that doll is finished, and a new doll is revealed inside the previous doll. The background and the music are additive: each chosen expression contributes to the final background and the final music. After the 4 dolls are set, a grand finale occurs.</p>

If a player wins, their photo is uploaded as a "long term memory" to the Neuron Leap "winners' wall".</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> When people watch television they like to talk about what they see on screen, as it happens; they want to share their experience with others. The problem is that these days, people want to watch things on their own time on their DVR or streamed online. Current social tools like Facebook and Twitter only allow for one small comment about a show but not to any specific moment in an episode, and there is the potential for spoilers. This project solves the problem by enabling time-shifted conversations that are linked to specific moments in episodes of TV shows.</p>
                    <p>The project was entirely designed and coded by <a href="http://www.carlj.us/">Carl Jamilkowski</a> and me.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> Conspiragram is an adventure/tag-style pervasive game where voluntary Players opt in to seek out Targets who have posted their location to Instagram. Players in an open environment (e.g. Washington Square Park) would use the Target's username, avatar and posted photo to try to identify what that person looks like and where they were when they took the photo. The Player can also scroll through the Target's photostream when available, looking for "Selfies". Once they have a good sense of the Target's appearance, they begin to search the environment for that person and then take a photo of them. Players post photos to one of the Conspiragram Team accounts, and the Target's username will be tagged, alerting them that they are referenced in a picture of themselves. This mechanic will engineer conversation in both the Players and the Targets (separately) about how that image was taken and what it means to have this vulnerability in public space.</p>
                    <p>The game was designed by all four members of the team.</p>
                    <p>I built the <a href="http://www.conspiragram.com/leaderboard/">leaderboard page</a> for the game. This involved dealing with the Instagram API to get all media with tag #conspiragram, and then aggregating the data by the user that posted.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> We had a project about researching women beer drinkers image in society. As part of the project, we created a poll to collect data about the perception that women tend to prefer light beer in spite of other beer types. For this, we created a google form that <a href="http://badbeeradsforwomen.tumblr.com/lightbeer">we embedded in the website</a>. Google stores the responses in another spreadsheet on google drive, and so we used tohe option from Google to publish the live data of the responses spreadsheet as a .csv that is reachable with a get request.</p>
                    <p>The graphic design of the visualization was made by Jiyoung Jung, and I built the webpage based on that.</p>
                    <p>The interesting part about this project was finding ways to have users post a form online and then us being able to read the live results, all this while avoiding the need of building a backend. I'm really interested in finding 'serverless' solutions for simple dynamic pages, and relying on already existing services and APIs.</p>

Using the capabilities of html5 for video, we expand over the traditional documentary format. We present the documentary with a 'choose your own adventure' style, where the audience can choose which path to follow in the documentary. I used popcorn.js to interface with the videos and the audio.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Room 14A</span> was an installation in a public window display. It was built as our final project for the <span class="bold">Pop Up Window Displays</span> class at <a target="_blank" href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP</a>. The main concept of the project was to create an old haunted living room, where a mysterious event happened in the past. When a person from the street touches the red button, mechanisms are activated to generate supernatural effects in the scene, thus generating the haunted enviornment.</p>
                    <h4>List of mechanisms from the scene</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main light and table light turn on, off and flicker</li>
                        <li>A book whose pages turn out</li>
                        <li>A rocking horse</li>
                        <li>Curtains that move</li>
                        <li>Video projection on the back windows</li>
                        <li>Big old tv that turns on and displays different footage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Venue</h3>
                    <p>The window installation was on display from 04/13/2014 to 04/15/2014, at 14A Washington Place, New York.</p>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea and the elements were decided between all team members. <a href="http://popupwindows.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/haunted-room/" target="_blank">Link to a blog post </a>documenting this process, and the refinement of the ideas.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Highlighted challenges</h3>
                    <p>Making the mechanisms hidden to the public was hard. On other physical projects, the location and distribution of the wires and outputs was not that important. It was not the case here; not only we had to find ways of recreating the effect we wanted, but also all these mechanisms had to be hidden from the public, to create the feeling of mystery.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p><span class="bold">Neuron Leap</span> is an interactive exhibit/game highlighting research by <a href="http://wendysuzuki.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Wendy Suzuki</a> from the <a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Center for Neural Science.</a> Her lab has early findings that link exercise to the strengthening of neural functions that support memory, recall, and learning. In Neuron Leap, visitors experience how our brain cells communicate and how a memory forms by playing this short, fast-paced, high-energy game. Players have to move their hips to progress through the game, and can collect bonuses when jumping at the right time.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>The user controls a matryoshka doll with their face. The doll rotates based on the user's head position. There are 4 different possible states: happy, sad, shy and surprised. The digital space will change based on the current detected expression from the user: the face of the doll, the decoration on its dress, the color of the background and the music. When the user is satisfied with the doll, he presses a button, that doll is finished, and a new doll is revealed inside the previous doll. The user has to finish 4 dolls, and he can choose the desired expression on each doll. The background and the music are additive: each chosen expression contributes to the final background and the final music. This way, the user is also building its own personalized quilt (the background is made like a Russian quilt) made of the combination of the chosen expressions, and same with the music. After the 4 dolls are set, a grand finale occurs.</p>
                    <p>The project was the final for a <span>Unity</span> class at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" target="_blank">ITP.</a>

                    <h3>Highlighted challenges</h3>
                    <p>For face recognition, we used <a href="https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/tree/master/FaceOSC" target="_blank">FaceOSC.</a> This tool, when detecting a face from a webcam, constantly sends OSC messages about face parameters: mouth height and width, jaw height, etc. The difficulty came when trying to match these values into a set of 3 expressions: happy, sad and surprised. It was hard to callibrate it so it was accurate for all different shapes of faces.</p>
